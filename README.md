# Healthy Plate
Search for a food item and learn it's history and nutrition information as well as recipes you can prepare in your own home


## Motivation
I wanted to build an application that would give people the ability to learn more about the foods they were consiming. I also hoped to be able to help people learn more about lesser known food items and how they can be incorperated into their diet.
